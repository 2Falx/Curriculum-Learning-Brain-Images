create_patches.py

1) Just 10 slices for each image are selected 
   Before: from 60 to 110 with step 5, select these 10 slices
   Now: from 0 to z_dim with step 5, than select the 10 central slices

2) PROBLEM:
   Keep last 2 slices images as test set, save train and test patches in the respective folders
   Instead you should divide the training and test on the patient, not on the slice of the same patches_train_path

3) Just the label of the first patient was used in Federico's code (???)
